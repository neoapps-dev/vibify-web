# Vibify Web
Hello! this is the web version of Vibify the Music Player (Android + Closed-Source) i decided to make the web version Open-Source and i only used HTML, CSS, and Pure JavaScript!

API isn't Open-Source but it's free to use!

in this project, i used an Unofficial YouTube Music API and a YouTube downloader to stream music!

- @thatmyusername (Telegram) for the YouTube Music and YouTube Downloader API
- me for 94% of the project!
